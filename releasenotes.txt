This is the third beta release of Itcl.
When final it will be the next major release of Itcl.
This version is named Itcl 4.0b3.

The difference to 4.0b2 which was never released as a source release is, that
it has a lot of fixes to run on OSX and Windows platform.

Other change is fully final integration of itclWidget package, so there is no
separate itclWidget package any more. Instead there is a Tcl script, which
will be loaded on demand.

There is only one difference to Itcl 3.4, the ::itcl::scope command does no
longer return strings like "@......." but a different syntax. This string
layout was always described as internal and not to be used at user level. On
the script level it does the same as before.

There is no known incompatibility.

There are a lot of new features in that version: especialy components and
delegation additional to inheritance. The ideas are mostly "stolen" from snit
written by Will Duquette.

The new class type is:
  - ::itcl::type

::itcl::type has all the features of ::itcl::class and additional functionality

The new functionality for ::itcl::type is
  - typemethod
  - typeconstructor
  - component <componentName> ?-inherit?
  - delegate option <optionSpec> to <component> ?as <target>?
  - delegate option * to <component>
  - delegate option * to <component> except <exceptions>
  - delegate method <methodName> to <component> ?as <target>?
  - delegate method <methodName> ?to <component>? using <pattern>
  - delegate method * ?to <component>? ?using <pattern>? ?except <exceptions>?
  - delegate typemethod <typeMethodName> to <component> ?as <target>?
  - delegate typemethod <typeMethodName> ?to <component>? using <pattern>
  - delegate typemethod * ?to <component>? ?using <pattern>? ?except <exceptions>?
  - option <optionSpec> <defaultValue>
  - option <optionSpec> <optionOptions>

optionSpec: something like the X-resource stuff: [list -font font Font]

optionOptions: ?-default <defaultValue>? ?-readonly? ?-cgetmethod <methodName>|-cgetmethodvar <varName>? ?-configuremethod <methodName>|-configuremethodvar <varName>? ?-validatemethod <methodName>|-validatemethodvar <varName>?

-default: the default value to use

-readonly: the value can only be set during initialization using the default
             value

-cgetmethod: this method can do for example additional formatting when
             extracting the value of an option
             The signature of that method is:
             myCgetMethod {option} { .... }

-configuremethod: this method can do additional stuff when
             setting the value of an option
             The signature of that method is:
             myConfigMethod {option value} { .... }

-validatemethod: this method can be used to validate the value when
             setting the value of an option
             The signature of that method is:
             myValidateMethod {option value} { .... }

-cgetmethodvar: is the name of a variable to be used. The variable
             contains the name of the cgetmethod to be used. This allows to
             initialize or change the method during runtime!

-configuremethodvar: is the name of a variable to be used. The variable
             contains the name of the coniguremethod to be used. This allows to
             initialize or change the method during runtime!

-validatemethodvar: is the name of a variable to be used. The variable
             contains the name of the validatemethod to be used. This allows to
             initialize or change the method during runtime!

You can only use one of ...method or ...methodvar not both for one option!
             For example you can only use -configuremethod and then it is not
             possible to use configuremethodvar for the same option.

Components are similar to variables in that they contain the name of an object
built for example from an ::itcl::type class. Then you are able to delegate 
methods, typemethods and options to that component. That means, whenever you
call a method in object A which has a component b initialized for example 
with string, and you have delegated method length of object A to component B
then "string length" will be called with the arguments. The same mechanism
is used for delegated options in that configure with the option name is called
for the object in component.

Typemethod is like a proc of ::itcl::class

Typconstructor is like the body of a Tcl proc and it is only called once for
::itcl::type when parsing of ::itcl::type is finished.

There is an special array variable "itcl_options", which contains the value
for each option with the option name as index. This can be used for fast access
but be aware, accessing that array does not trigger cgetmethod, configuremethod
and validatemethod or the methods in the correspondig variables (cgetmethodvar
...)

These are the new introspection methods for ::itcl::type :
  - info components ?pattern?
  - info component ?<componentName>?
  - info default <methodName> <argName> <resultVar>
  - info delegated method
  - info delegated method <methodName> ?-as? ?-except? ?-to? ?-using?
  - info delegated methods
  - info delegated option
   -info delegated option <optionName> ?-as? ?-except? ?-to?
  - info delegated options
  - info delegated typemethods
  - info instances ?pattern?
  - info method <methodName> ?-protection? ?-type? ?-name? ?-args? ?-body?"
  - info methods ?pattern?
  - info option <optionName> ?-defaultvalue? ?-value? ?-readonly? ?-cgetmethod?|?-cgetmethodvar? ?-configuremethod?|?-configuremethodvar? ?-validatemethod?|?-validatemethodvar?
  - info options ?pattern?
  - info typemethod <methodName> ?-protection? ?-type? ?-name? ?-args? ?-body?"
  - info typemethods ?pattern?
  - info typevariable <varName> ?-protection? ?-type? ?-name? ?-init? ?-value? ?-config?"
  - info typevars ?pattern?
  - info variables ?pattern?

There is also an experimental class type
 - ::itcl::extendedclass

available, which will be used to build itk like megawidgets (a la Iwidgets)
in the future without the need to use itk.

WARNING the interfaces are not yet described in detail, as there may be
changes, so the use of ::itcl::extended class is at the moment
"on your own risk", as the interfaces may still change.

At the moment mostly all of the interfaces of ::itcl::type are supported
for ::itcl::extendedclass and some additional ones where the API has not yet
settled, so they are not described.
